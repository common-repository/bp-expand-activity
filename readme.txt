Adds AJAX capabilities to expand shortened activity stream wire comments without reloading the page.

== Description ==

Activity streams cut long texts and show an excerpt, and some items have no direct link to that exact content. This plugin solves the problem by placing a link below the excerpt which will either expand the text with AJAX (if a wire comment) or open a new window with the direct link (e.g. blog posts and comments).
